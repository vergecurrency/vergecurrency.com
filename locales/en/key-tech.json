    "boxtitle": "Technology Focused On The End-User",       
    "boxtext1": "Verge was originally created based on the idea of providing end-user identity obfuscation suited for everyday use.",    
    "boxtext2": "We believe that every human deserves the right to privacy and with that idea in mind we pride ourselves on being able to provide several different technology integrations specifically designed to enhance the overall safety, security, and anonymity of users who transact across the Verge network.",    
    "boxtext3": "As time progresses this page will update as we integrate new technology onto our network.",    
    "boxtext4": "Below, you will find a brief overview of some of the core technologies that Verge offers as of today.",    
    "keytitle": "Key features",
    "keytext1": "Low fees, quick transactions, high circulation volume, and multiplatform support are the ingredients that make Verge perfectly positioned for mass adoption.",
    "keytext2": "Transaction speeds are ultra-fast compared to other coins.",
    "tortitle": "Tor IP obfuscation",
    "tortext1": "Tor, derived from an acronym for the original software project name The Onion Router, is an IP obfuscation service which enables anonymous communication across a layered circuit based network.",
    "tortext2": "Verge integrates Tor in all of our wallets, thereby eliminating any single point at which the communicating peers can be determined through network surveillance that relies upon knowing its source and destination.",
    "i2ptitle": "I2P tunneling",
    "i2ptext1": "I2P is a highly obfuscated tunneling service using ipv6 that anonymizes all Verge data being sent over the network.",
    "i2ptext2": "As Verge moves forward, I2P is becoming one of the key technologies ensuring anonymity of the users.",
    "stealthtitle": "Dual-Key Stealth Addressing",
    "stealthtext1": "Dual-Key Stealth Addressing allows senders to create an unlimited number of one-time destinations addresses on behalf of the recipient without any interaction between the parties. Stealth addresses are a method by which additional obfuscation can be implemented to further protect the receiving party when transacting with Verge.",
    "stealthtext2": "When multiple users send funds to a stealth address, rather than these transactions appearing on the blockchain as multiple payments to the same address, they instead appear as multiple payments going to different addresses.",
    "ringcttitle": "Ring Confidential Transactions",
    "ringcttext1": "Ring Confidential Transactions ensure that only the participants of a transaction are privy to the values being sent back and forth while simultaneously hiding the values from the sight of the rest of the world.",
    "ringcttext2": "Ring Confidential Transactions are essential to ensuring anonymity of our users.",
    "rsktitle": "RSK Smart Contracts",
    "rsktext": "RSK is the first open-source smart contract platform with a 2-way peg to Verge that also rewards the Verge miners via merge-mining, allowing them to actively participate in the Smart Contract revolution. RSK goal is to add value and functionality to the Verge ecosystem by enabling smart-contracts, near instant payments and higher-scalability.",
    "encrypttitle": "Encrypted Messaging",
    "encrypttext": "Encrypted messaging is a P2P (peer-to-Peer) instant messaging system utilizing state-of-the-art encryption technology to keep your communications private. All messages are encrypted by the proven AES-256-CBC algorithm, and distributed between nodes in such a way as to prevent the recipients of messages from being inferred by assailants utilizing sophisticated traffic analysis.",
    "atstitle": "Atomic Swaps",
    "atstext1": "Atomic Swaps, or atomic cross-chain trading, is a technology that enables direct peer-to-peer trading across separate blockchains with BIP65 support and eliminates the need for trusted third parties.",
    "atstext2": "Traditional centralized exchanges can be replaced by decentralized exchanges (DEX), which means you always keep your funds in your wallet and do not rely on an intermediary. By enabling Atomic Swaps capability, Verge takes a proactive step towards a decentralized future.",
    "algtitle": "Multi-algorithm Mining",
    "algtext1": "Verge Currency uses Proof of Work (POW) mining principle. It is one of the few cryptocurrencies to have a multi-algorithm support.",
    "algtext2": "Verge has 5 different hash functions: Scrypt, X17, Lyra2rev2, myr-groestl and blake2s.  Such design allows for a more equal access. Verge is not a private company funded by pre-mined coins or an ICO.",
    "algtext3": "Allowing our community to mine Verge with good technology is vital.",
    "inttitle": "Integrations",
    "inttext1": "Powering real world mainstream adoption with P2P integrations",
    "inttext2": "Verge is constantly moving towards mainstream adoption. Verge integration on messaging and social media platforms is an important strategic step to accomplish this goal.",
    "inttext3": "With no installation required from either party, XVG coins can be sent and received over Twitter, Discord and Telegram."
