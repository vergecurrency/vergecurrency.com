The SPV technology allows average transaction confirmation times to drop to ~5 seconds (instead of ~30 seconds for non-Electrum).

Per <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)' target='_blank'>Wikipedia</a>, the toolkit was named QT because \"the letter Q looked appealing in Haavard's Emacs typeface, and 't' was inspired by Xt, the X toolkit\". "
    },
    "qtwallet": {
      "question": "What is a QT Wallet?",
      "answer": "QT wallets require that you download the entire <a href='https://verge-blockchain.com/' target='_blank'>Verge blockchain</a> to your computer. In other words, your computer must download a record of every single Verge transaction that has ever occurred. Currently, the Verge blockchain is ~1GB and will continue to climb as more users make transactions. If you are using a QT wallet, make sure your device has enough extra storage to handle it.",
      "answer2": "Every time you open your QT wallet, the wallet will synchronize and download the latest blockchain data to your computer. If you decide to use a QT wallet, you will most likely want to use it on a regular basis; or it could take an hour or more (depending on how long it has been since you opened your wallet last) to download the latest blockchain updates."
