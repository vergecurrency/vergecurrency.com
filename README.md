```

## Installing

Use your favorite terminal to get up and running by following the next steps:

_Clone the project into a directory on your machine:_

```
git clone https://github.com/vergecurrency/vergecurrency.com.git
```

_Cd into the newly created directory:_

_Install dependencies:_

yarn install
```

_Run the application:_

```
yarn run dev
```

_Open the website in your browser:_

```

```

## Running the tests

We have implemented 2 linters in this project.

### ESLint with AirBNB config

_ESLint a single file:_

```
./node_modules/.bin/eslint _filename_.js
```

_ESLint the pages_

```
./node_modules/.bin/eslint pages/**/*.js
```

_EsLint the whole project_

```
./node_modules/.bin/eslint */*.js
```

### Node SASS Lint

_Lint a single file_

```
./node_modules/.bin/sass-lint -c ./.sasslintrc './path/to/file.scss'
```

_Lint all the SCSS files_

```
./node_modules/.bin/sass-lint -c ./.sasslintrc '**/*.scss'
```

## Local deployment

We're using the NextJS build system. To build, just run the following command:

```
yarn run build
```

It will then build and export the whole project.

To run the build locally:

```
gulp
```

## Translations

### Folder structure
Make sure you only use the short name for languages. So for example the folder name for the English language is `en`, Russian will be `ru` and France will be `fr`. If you would use a folder name that has a different name it will not work. So for example `en-GB` wouldn't work. If you feel this is a thing that we should allow, then please contact me on Discord (StanFaas).

### New translations
When adding a new language to our locales folder you should make sure to add the language code (folder name) to the `languages.json` file.
This file can be found in: `./lists/languages.json`. Be aware that the language will be active directly after you add it to that file.
