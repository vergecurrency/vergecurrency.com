# Verge Security Incident Response Team (Verge-CSIRT)

## Introduction
Privacy and security are fundamental to Verge.  To help grow the confidence in the security of Verge products and services (i.e. website, official communication channels, software and digital currency) we're launching the Verge Security Incident Response Team (Verge-CSIRT).

Verge-CSIRT is Verge's cyber investigations and forensics team and the primary point of contact for security related issues, incidents, or vulnerabilities involving any Verge products or services.

Verge-CSIRT is where you can come for the following:

- To report security related issues, incidents, or vulnerabilities involving any Verge products or services (i.e. website, official communication channels, software or digital currency).
- To get security advisories regarding Verge products and services.
- To get guidance and best practices for protecting your digital currency (Verge and others).
